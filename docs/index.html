<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is the Bill of Material for a replica ZX Spectrum 48K Issue 3B. It is optimized for <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/ZX_Spectrum_48_Issue_3B_Redrawn.html">PABB&rsquo;s ZX Spectrum 48 Issue 3B Redrawn</a> boards.</p>
<h2>Read Me First!</h2>
<p>If you want to build your own ZX Spectrum, be aware that the machine was designed in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>While almost all of the standard components are still available, some components are very rare by now. You will need <em>all</em> of the listed components (except of those marked optional). We recommend that you try to get the components marked as <span class="rare">Rare</span> first, so you won&rsquo;t waste your money on standard components if you fail to get all the rare ones.</p>
<p>This bill of material only comprises of the components required for the mainboard itself. For a complete ZX Spectrum replica, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>This board, fully assembled and tested.</li>
<li>A ZX Spectrum or ZX Spectrum+ case with keyboard. You can use an original case, but there are also replica cases, keyboard membranes and rubber key mats.</li>
<li>A power supply with correct polarity: 9 V, 1.5 A, 5.5mm/2.1mm barrel plug, <strong>center negative</strong>. Note that most wall power supplies on the market are center positive, and would instantly kill your ZX Spectrum.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sockets</h2>
<p>This list contains sockets for all chips for your convenience. It is of course up to you if you want to use all of them.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This is not an official list! It was collected and reviewed by Sinclair enthusiasts.</p>

<p>In other words: You might spend a lot of money, and end up with a non-functioning board or a cardboard box full of useless components.</p>
<p><strong>Use at your own risk!</strong></p>

<p>This list is meant to be a community work. Our goal is to have a canonical list that people can rely on when ordering parts for building an own ZX Spectrum mainboard.</p>
<p>However, this list may not be free of errors. If you have found one, please <a href="https://github.com/shred/zxspectrum-bom/issues">open an issue</a> or send a patch.</p>
