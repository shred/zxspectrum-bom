# Introduction

This is the Bill of Material for a replica ZX Spectrum 48K Issue 3B. It is optimized for [PABB's ZX Spectrum 48 Issue 3B Redrawn](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/ZX_Spectrum_48_Issue_3B_Redrawn.html) boards.

## Read Me First!

If you want to build your own ZX Spectrum, be aware that the machine was designed in the early 1980s.

While almost all of the standard components are still available, some components are very rare by now. You will need *all* of the listed components (except of those marked optional). We recommend that you try to get the components marked as <span class="rare">Rare</span> first, so you won't waste your money on standard components if you fail to get all the rare ones.

This bill of material only comprises of the components required for the mainboard itself. For a complete ZX Spectrum replica, you will need:

* This board, fully assembled and tested.
* A ZX Spectrum or ZX Spectrum+ case with keyboard. You can use an original case, but there are also replica cases, keyboard membranes and rubber key mats.
* A power supply with correct polarity: 9 V, 1.5 A, 5.5mm/2.1mm barrel plug, **center negative**. Note that most wall power supplies on the market are center positive, and would instantly kill your ZX Spectrum.

## Sockets

This list contains sockets for all chips for your convenience. It is of course up to you if you want to use all of them.

## Disclaimer

This is not an official list! It was collected and reviewed by Sinclair enthusiasts.

Although we strive to make the information in this project as helpful and accurate as possible, it is provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind either expressed or implied.

In other words: You might spend a lot of money, and end up with a non-functioning board or a cardboard box full of useless components.

**Use at your own risk!**

## Contribute

This list is meant to be a community work. Our goal is to have a canonical list that people can rely on when ordering parts for building an own ZX Spectrum mainboard.

However, this list may not be free of errors. If you have found one, please [open an issue](https://github.com/shred/zxspectrum-bom/issues) or send a patch.
